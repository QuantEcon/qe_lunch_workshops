# qe_lunch_workshops

### Introduction

The QuantEcon lunch workshops are specified with the following three tables:

- Table 1 schedules the topic(s), speaker(s), date and venue for the seminar in ``week_xx``,
- Table 2 lists volunteer speakers, and
- Table 3 shows interested topics ``xxx`` linking to corresponding issues ``topic: xxx`` in the Issue Tracker.

All presentation materials corresponding to ``week_xx`` under the column ``Week No.`` of Table 1 are stored either in the same name folder above (there will be separate sub-folders after their names inside the folder ``week_xx`` if there is over one speaker) or the corresponding link under column ``Topics`` of Table 1.

Email Shu Hu ([shu.hu@anu.edu.au](mailto:shu.hu@anu.edu.au)) if you are interested in hearing or giving a talk (20-55 minutes) related to any topics of computational economics.
