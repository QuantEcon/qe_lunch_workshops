# Github Classroom
## Use case in Computational Economics course

# Very useful for certain cases

**Efficient way to distribute identical repositories for student work**

- Based on using Git and Github, students have to know how
- Requires Github organization
- Assignments have to be prepared in a *template* repository 
- Works best for individual assignment, work in groups also possible
- Actively developed, new features appear constantly

# How it works

1. Create Github organization
2. Create classroom, upload student identifiers
3. Create assignment *template* repository in Github
4. Create the assignment
5. Distribute the assignment link

# Grading

- Student work ends up in their repositories in the organization
- Grading in each repository individually
- There are tools/scripts based on Github API
- Shared grading has been not straightforward
# Features still to explore

- New tools in Github classroom
- Provided editor/IDE for the students (cloud?)
- Automatic grading facility (Github actions?)
